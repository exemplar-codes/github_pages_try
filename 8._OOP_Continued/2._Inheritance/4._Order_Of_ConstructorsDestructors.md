# 3. Order Of ConstructorsDestructors
Created Sunday 26 April 2020


* We need to have the base/parent in existence if we want to use a derived class.

When we create an object for the derived class. A Constructor will be called first for the parent, in the end will destructor will be called for the parent(we need a base to live before the base is deallocated).
**Order is like a stack. Push all then pop all. **

Literally speaking Car has a piece called vehicle. **Derived has got parts from Base.**

* Keep in mind that Vehicle is still independent from Car. No parts. i.e Only constructors/destructors for base will be invoked if we make a base type object.


*****


* This is like an initialization list, Car calls the Vehicle operator. **This is implicit.**
* We need to provide the constructor/destructor **explicitly **if we use a parameterized/deep-copy constructor/deep-copy-assignment opertator .i.e default contstructor has been shadowed. Same as constructor fundamentals.
* Only default constructors can be called implicitly(and only for the parents, not grand). For using param constructor in the derived class, we need to explicitly call the parent constructor from the child class constructor.


*****

**Multilevel inheritance**:
Vehicle->Car->HondaCity. Using the existence principle.
constu V
constu C
constu H
destru H
destru C
destru V

* Remember: Honda City can access only Car constructor, it cannot access Vehicles constructor.
