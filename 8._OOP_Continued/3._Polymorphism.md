# 3. Polymorphism
Created Monday 27 April 2020


* Literally means many forms.
* We the concept of polymorphism to make our code dynamic(i.e context dependent behavior), this decreases the switch cases or huge if else ladders.


It is of two types:

1. Compile Time: The *form* is decided at compile time.
2. Run Time: We decide the *form* at run-time.

**form **here refers to the chosen behavior.
