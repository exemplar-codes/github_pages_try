# 4. Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes
Created Monday 27 April 2020


Pure Virtual Functions: The functions which don't have any definition of their own. They just have the function signature with virtual preceding it and an = 0;
Syntax: virtual ret_type fname() = 0;

* Any class which contains a pure virtual function is known as an **abstract class. **i.e presence of atleast one pure virtual function.
* We cannot make an object for an abstract class(error). We can still create pointers, though. **We don't want to make it usable directly. It may cause problems. Virtual functions may be undefined here, strictly. This is the reason for =0;.**
* The child class has some options:
	1. We can add definitions for all the virtual functions.
	2. We may not define some/all of the inherited virtual functions, this makes the child class as abstract too.

Use case:

1. In our [3. Polymorphism:2. Run Time Polymorphism](./3._Polymorphism/2._Run_Time_Polymorphism.md) , we saw a company. This means we cannot create the employee object directly.
